            <p> Hi, I'm Jacob Brunsting, a second year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. My passion is solving complex problems with well-structured and maintainable software, and I enjoy collaborating with others on large projects. I have qualifications in Java, C, Python, CSS, and Javascript, among others. In my first coop term, I worked as an Android developer at WeMesh, and received a Coop qualifications Award from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and received a coop rating of Outstanding from my employer. At WeMesh I worked both individually, and as a team, to add features to the WeMesh Android app. In my free time I have worked on several projects, including two android apps, a crossword solving program written in Python, and this website, written in raw HTML, CSS, and Javascript (see all of my projects and job qualifications <a href="qualifications.html">here</a>). As a student, I have taken courses on a wide variety of topics, including physics, english, and economics, in addition to my regular computer science and math courses, and was on the Term Deans Honor List for both of my previous school terms, meaning I had an overall average of greater than 87% for both terms. </p>
