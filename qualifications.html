            <h4 class="work_title"> Android Developer (Java) at WeMesh - May 2016 - August 2016 </h4>
            <p class="work_writeup"> At WeMesh, I worked with a team of other Android developers to add new features and bug fixes to the WeMesh Android app, an app that allows you to watch synced videos with other people, and vote on videos to watch.
                <br> I worked independently to redesign voting animations in the app, allow the video to be smoothly resized into the corner of the screen, reorganize, simplify, and encapsulate the code for the main page of the app, and write the client code for server-side pagination for most of the lists in the app, among other features. I also worked with the rest of the team to add features like the ability to watch videos from the Viki TV show provider, allow users to watch completely random YouTube videos, and general bug and crash fixes.
                <br> During my time at WeMesh, I received the NSERC Experience Award for my coop term, and earned a work term evaluation of Outstanding. In my work term evaluation, my employers called me a <i>great team member</i> with <i>great communication skills.</i> </p>

            <h4 class="project_title"> Portable Planner (Java) </h4>
            <p class="project_writeup"> Portable Planner is an app I wrote near the start my co-op term at WeMesh. It allows you to put events in a calendar, write and tag notes, and set reminders. I wrote it largely to gain a better understanding of how to build structured apps in Android Studio. You can find it on the app store <a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myplanner.myplanner&hl=en" target="_top">here</a>. </p>

            <h4 class="project_title"> My Math Class (Java) </h4>
            <p class="project_writeup"> My Math Class was my first introduction to Android Studio. I created it over Christmas break while learning how to write Android apps. It allows you to randomly generate math quizzes in several different categories and difficulties. You can find it on the app store <a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brunsting.jacob.mymathquiz&hl=en">here</a>. </p>

            <h4 class="project_title"> Crossword Solver (Python) </h4>
            <p class="project_writeup"> I wrote this crossword puzzle solver as a way of gaining experience in Python, and trying out a crossword solving algorithm I had thought of one night. It allows you to draw a crossword puzzle in a grid and provide a word bank, and then it will solve the crossword for all possible solutions using words from the word bank. </p>

            <h4 class="project_title"> Mastermind Solver (C) </h4>
            <p class="project_writeup"> This C program plays the game Mastermind, where you create a code, and it tries to guess what code you created. It is fairly simple right now, but in the future I am planning on having it repeatedly play against itself to optimise itself by changing several constants I currently have set to arbitrary values. </p>
