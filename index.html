                About Me
            </h3> <img src="profile_pic.png" alt="Profile Picture" class="profile_image">
            <p> Hi, I'm Jacob Brunsting, a second year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. My passion is solving complex problems with well-structured and maintainable software, and I enjoy collaborating with others on large projects. I have experience with Java, C, Python, CSS, and Javascript, among others. In my first co-op term, I worked as an Android developer at WeMesh, a company which makes an app combining video watching and instant messaging. At WeMesh I worked both individually, and with a team, to add major features to the WeMesh Android app. While working there, I received a Co-op Experience Award from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and received a coop rating of Outstanding from my employer. In my free time I have worked on several projects, including two android apps, a crossword solving program written in Python, and this website, written in raw HTML, CSS, and Javascript (see all of my projects and job qualifications <a href="qualifications.html">here</a>). As a student, I have taken courses on a wide variety of topics, including physics, english, and economics, in addition to my regular computer science and math courses, and was on the Term Deans Honor List for both of my previous school terms. </p>

                        <p class="hover_text"> From May 2016 to August 2016, I worked as an Android developer at WeMesh, a company that develops a community video watching app. At WeMesh, I worked with a team of other Android developers to add new features and bug fixes to the WeMesh Android app, an app that allows you to watch synced videos with other people, and vote on videos to watch.
                            <br>I worked independently to redesign voting animations in the app, allow the video to be smoothly resized into the corner of the screen, reorganize, simplify, and encapsulate the code for the main page of the app, and write the client code for server-side pagination for most of the lists in the app, among other features. I also worked with the rest of the team to add features like the ability to watch videos from the Viki TV show provider, allow users to watch completely random YouTube videos, and general bug and crash fixes.
                            <br>During my time at WeMesh, I received the NSERC Experience Award for my coop term, and earned a work term evaluation of Outstanding. In my work term evaluation, my employers called me a great team member with great communication skills. </p> <a href="qualifications.html">more</a> <img class="fade_out_overlay" src="fade_out.png"> </div>

It allows you to put events in a calendar, write and tag notes, and set reminders.
